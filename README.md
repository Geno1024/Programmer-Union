This repository is to advocate the "996ICU" activity. To make some real change, this repo provides a choice to build a stable programmer union. Those who agree with this direction are welcomed to participate in this repo.

You can give some advice to perfect the manifesto or provide translations in different languages. Feel free to share your ideas of next steps. We celebrate your contribution!
